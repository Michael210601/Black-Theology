Black Theology – The Essential Reading
Black Theology can mean lots of different things to different people however generally it is understood to be the exploration of the connection between God and his relationship with Black people around the world and the struggles of Black people for equality. Black Theology normally applies to Christianity and acts as a liberation theology which means it is viewed as a way to address social injustice through the use of spiritual guidance/texts.
This vision of theology has a wide range of use across academics. The work on this topic within Augustine House is broad and there is a wide variety of different scholars and experts whose work on this topic are available within Augustine House including important authors such as James H. Cone and Robert Beckford. These texts are mostly obviously useful for Philosophy and Religious Studies although their insights into ethnic minority movements for change give them relevance for History, Sociology, Politics, American Studies and more. 
Black Theology can be useful to provide insights into movements for change with the Civil Rights Movement in the United States being deeply influenced by Christianity with leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr directly connecting Christianity with the concept of equality. Many different protest groups and movements for change believe that Jesus shared their views of the need for equality through his direct actions and interactions with everyone ranging from the poor to prostitutes. Therefore, Black Theology continues to have relevance within movements for change in both the past and the present. 
This post will contain a list of the key Black Theology texts available within Augustine House alongside a photo of the cover and a summary of the text.

  Witnessing & Testifying: Black Women, Religion and Civil Rights by Rosetta Ross
Ross looks at seven female civil rights activists, Ella Josephine Baker, Septima Poinsette Clark, Fannie Lou Hamer, Victoria Way DeLee, Clara Muhammad, Diane Nash, and Ruby Doris Smith Robinson.
Ross shows how their moral formation and work reflect both womanist consciousness and practices of witness and testimony, both emergent from the black religious context.
There is examination of the idea that civil rights activism for these women was religiously impelled and how this connection can provide an ongoing motivation for engagement in civil rights activism.
